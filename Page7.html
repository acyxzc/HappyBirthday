<p><i> Yesterday, as we gather to celebrate Yana's & Jophanie's Birthday, I can't help but feel the warmth of our bond wrapping around us. 
  It's impossible not to notice the absence of some dear faces among us.
  Though miles or circumstances may keep them away today, their presence is felt in every shared laugh, and cherished memory we revisit. 
  Let's remember that our connection knows no bounds of time or distance. Whether near or far, our friendship, our ZeCi remains strong. 
  we should cherish the moments we shared yesterday and hold them close, knowing that each of us is a vital thread in the fabric of our group. 
  Here's to the memories we've created and those yet to come. uniting us always.

Cheers to us, <br>
Ace B.
